# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-06-14
- Added AutoUpdate to LocalizedStringReference class. When enabled, the string will automatically be loaded any time a change is detected and the UpdateString event can be used to update the string. With AutoUpdate enabled calling GetLocalizedString is not necessary. 
- Fixed StringTableEditor changes being lost when using inline editing.
- Fixed LocalizationBehaviour not updating the first time when LocalizationSettings are already initialized. 
- Fixed LocalizationBehaviour not updating correctly if the asset or table has already been loaded.
- Improved drop down label in LocalizedStringReferencePropertyDrawer. Multi line text is now correctly shown. (LOC-57)
- Added KeyDatabase.FindSimilarKey. Returns the closest match using a Levenshtein approximation.
- Improved key matching when using Localize context menu for Text components.
- Updated to Addressables version '0.8.6-preview'.

## [0.3.2] - 2019-05-09
- Added support for ugui package in 2019.2.0a15. ugui support is optional and will be enabled automatically if the ugui package is in the project.
- Removed support for 2018.3. The ugui support requires optional assemblies which are not supported in 2018.3.
- AssemblyScannerCache now uses UnityEditor.TypeCache in 2019.2 which should provide improved performance in Editor.
- Added an error when adding non-persistent assets to asset tables.
- Fixed StringTableEditor changes being lost due to not setting the table dirty.

## [0.3.1] - 2019-05-02
- Added KeyDatabase. All string keys are now contained within this and mapped to a unique(to the database) id value which is used by the table.
- Assets are now grouped in Addressables by the locale. This allows you to serve them on-demand for a particular language, instead of bundling them with the game release. Shared assets are stored in a separate group.
- Assets are now removed from Addressables when they are not referenced by any Asset Tables.
- Fixed UIElements issues in 2019.1+.
- Merged LocalizationPlayerSettings into LocalizationEditorSettings.
- Removed AddressableAssetTableT.GetAsset. GetAssetAsync should be used instead.

- Fixed UIElements compilation issues in 2019.1+
- Updated to Addressables version '0.7.5-preview'.
