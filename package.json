  "description": "Use the Localization package to easily configure localization settings for your application.\n\nAdd support for multiple languages and regional variants, including:\n\n• String localization: Set different strings to display based on locale. Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.\n• Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.\n• Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.\n• Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.",

([LOC-1087](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1087))\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Exported XLIFF 1.2 documents will now include the required attribute datatype on the file elements. (LOC-1091)\n- Fixed errors in smart strings that contain nested localized strings with additional selectors/formatters when the string table had not yet loaded. ([LOC-1087](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1087))\n- Fixed the GameObjectLocalizer not updating if a persistent variable is changed. ([LOC-964](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-964))\n- Improved error handling when trying to parse an invalid localized property variant value. ([LOC-1081](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1081))\n- Improved performance when removing an item from the Localization Tables Window.
