  "description": "Use the Localization package to easily configure localization settings for your application.\n\nAdd support for multiple languages and regional variants, including:\n\n• String localization: Set different strings to display based on locale. Use the Smart Strings feature to add logic to automatically replace specific strings, such as placeholders and plurals.\n• Asset localization: Use a different asset (such as a texture, model, or audio file) based on a locale.\n• Pseudo-localization: Test how your project will adapt to different localizations at an early stage, before adding your translations.\n• Import and export localization data to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets.\n\nAdd localization to your projects using the Localization package to help make your applications more accessible to a wider audience.",

    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n- CSV files will now be exported in UTF8 without the unesessesary byte order mark (BOM).\n- Improved string and asset picker in 2022.2+. The search provider will now start in visual query builder mode and the Inspector panel is now disabled, it was not used.\n- Removed the Locale Source option from the **Locale Generator** window.\n- Renamed **Locale Generator** to **Add Locale** in Localization Settings.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- A locale change event is no longer sent in playmode when a change is detected to the localization tables. This is now only done in edit mode when previewing a locale via the localization scene controls. ([LOC-1025](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1025))\n- Fixed incorrect calculation of string table row height in the Table window. ([LOC-1058](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1058))\n- Improved handling of dependency operations that may be released after execution. The localization initialization operation will no longer fail during WaitForCompletion when the addressable initialization operation is automatically released. ([LOC-1039](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1039))\n- Improved null handling of `TrackedProperties` values when something went wrong during serialization.\n- We now fail the initialization operation if one of the sub-operations fails. ([LOC-1038](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/LOC-1038))"
